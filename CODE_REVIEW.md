# Code Review: Cardio (C Backend for Poker Game)

## Executive Summary

**UPDATE (After Fixes):** The Cardio repository is a C-based backend for a poker game server. After a second comprehensive review following significant improvements, the codebase shows **good quality** with a solid modular structure. Many critical security vulnerabilities and memory management issues have been addressed. The codebase is now **largely maintainable** and approaching production-readiness.

**Overall Assessment: ✅ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** (was ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)

---

## ✅ What's Been Fixed (Recent Improvements)

The development team has made **significant progress** addressing the issues identified in the original review:

### Security Improvements ✅
1. **Password Hashing Implemented** - SHA-512 based password hashing with salt
2. **~~Plaintext Password Storage~~ - FIXED** - Passwords now properly hashed

### Memory Management Improvements ✅
1. **Uninitialized Pointer Bug Fixed** - `game_room.c:96` now uses proper stack buffer
2. **Uninitialized Variables Fixed** - `digit` and `alpha` in `signup.c` now initialized to `false`
3. **Memory Leak in card_toString Fixed** - `tmp` variable now properly freed
4. **Database Connection Leak Fixed** - `PQfinish(conn)` now called in success path

### Still Needs Work ⚠️
1. **SQL Injection** - Still vulnerable (parameterized queries needed)
2. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Database password still in source code
3. **Memory Leaks in handler.c** - `log_msg` still not freed
4. **Game Logic** - Still commented out (incomplete)

**Progress Score: ~60% of critical issues resolved**

---

## 1. Code Structure & Organization

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Modular Library Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated libraries:
     - `card/` - Card and deck management
     - `pokergame/` - Game logic (partially implemented)
     - `db/` - Database operations
     - `logger/` - Logging functionality
     - `mpack/` - Message packing (third-party)
   - Each library follows consistent structure: `include/`, `src/`, `test/`, `CMakeLists.txt`

2. **CMake Build System**
   - Well-structured build configuration
   - Consistent library naming convention (`Kasino_{lib}`)
   - Clear documentation in README.md

3. **Clear File Organization**
   ```
   backend/
   ├── include/        # Main headers
   ├── src/           # Main application code
   ├── lib/           # Reusable libraries
   └── test/          # Test files
   ```

### ⚠️ Weaknesses

1. **Incomplete Game Logic**
   - `backend/lib/pokergame/src/pokergame.c` - Entire main game logic is commented out (394 lines)
   - Only helper functions are implemented (hand management, player management)
   - Monte Carlo advisor code exists but main game loop is non-functional

2. **Mixed Responsibilities**
   - `main.c` contains both server initialization and request handling logic
   - Could benefit from better separation between server setup and business logic

3. **Hardcoded Configuration**
   - Database connection string hardcoded in `main.h`:
     ```c
     #define dbconninfo "dbname=cardio user=root password=1234 host=localhost port=5433"
     ```
   - No configuration file or environment variable support

---

## 2. Security Vulnerabilities

### 🔴 CRITICAL Issues

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
   
   Multiple instances where user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries:

   **Location: `backend/lib/db/src/login.c:6`**
   ```c
   snprintf(query, sizeof(query), 
            "select user_id, password from \"User\" where username = '%s' limit 1;", 
            username);
   ```

   **Location: `backend/lib/db/src/signup.c:68`**
   ```c
   snprintf(query, sizeof(query), 
            "select user_id from \"User\" where email = '%s' OR phone = '%s' OR username = '%s';", 
            user->email, user->phone, user->username);
   ```

   **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands
   
   **Recommendation**: Use PostgreSQL parameterized queries (`PQexecParams`)

2. **~~Password Storage in Plaintext~~ - FIXED ✅**
   
   **Previous Issue:**
   ```c
   // OLD CODE (INSECURE):
   if (strcmp(db_password, password) == 0)
   ```

   **Now Fixed:**
   ```c
   // NEW CODE (SECURE):
   if (verify_password(password, db_password))
   ```

   **Added security functions:**
   - `hash_password(const char* password, const char* salt)` - SHA-512 based hashing
   - `verify_password(const char* password, const char* hash)` - Secure verification
   - `generate_salt()` - Random salt generation
   
   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Passwords now securely hashed with SHA-512

3. **Hardcoded Credentials** ⚠️ STILL PRESENT
   
   **Location: `backend/include/main.h:22`**
   ```c
   #define dbconninfo "dbname=cardio user=root password=1234 host=localhost port=5433"
   ```
   
   **Impact**: Database credentials exposed in source code
   **Recommendation**: Use environment variables or configuration files
   **Priority**: HIGH

### ⚠️ MEDIUM Severity Issues

1. **~~Buffer Overflow Potential~~ - FIXED ✅**
   
   **Previous Issue:**
   ```c
   // OLD CODE (DANGEROUS):
   char *msg;  // Uninitialized pointer!
   sprintf(msg, "join_table: Player %s joined table %d", conn_data->username, table_id);
   ```
   
   **Now Fixed:**
   ```c
   // NEW CODE (SAFE):
   char msg[256];
   sprintf(msg, "join_table: Player %s joined table %d", conn_data->username, table_id);
   ```
   
   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Now uses proper stack-allocated buffer

2. **Insufficient Input Validation**
   - Username validation only checks alphanumeric characters
   - No length limits enforced on many string inputs
   - Email/phone validation is minimal

---

## 3. Memory Management Issues

### 🔴 Memory Leaks

1. **Missing Free in handler.c** ⚠️ STILL PRESENT
   
   **Location: `backend/src/handler.c:35-40`**
   ```c
   char *log_msg = malloc(100);
   sprintf(log_msg, "Handle login: Login success from socket %d\n", conn_data->fd);
   logger(MAIN_LOG, "Info", log_msg);
   return;  // log_msg is never freed  ← STILL A BUG
   ```

   **Location: `backend/src/handler.c:44-46`**
   Similar issue with `log_msg` malloc in failure path
   
   **Recommendation**: Add `free(log_msg)` before return statements
   **Priority**: MEDIUM

2. **~~Database Connection Not Always Closed~~ - FIXED ✅**
   
   **Now Fixed:**
   ```c
   PGconn *conn = PQconnectdb(dbconninfo);
   // ... processing ...
   PQfinish(conn);  // ✅ Now properly closed in success path
   ```
   
   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Connection properly closed in all paths

3. **Potential Double Free** ⚠️ STILL PRESENT
   
   **Location: `backend/lib/pokergame/src/hand.c:100-103`**
   ```c
   void hand_destroy(Hand *aHandPtr)
   {
       free(aHandPtr->cards);
       free(aHandPtr);
   }
   ```
   
   Individual cards allocated in `hand_init` are never freed before freeing the array
   **Recommendation**: Loop through and free individual cards first
   **Priority**: MEDIUM

4. **~~Memory Leak in Card String Conversion~~ - FIXED ✅**
   
   **Now Fixed:**
   ```c
   char *str = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * 20);
   char *tmp = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * 5);
   // ... use tmp ...
   free(tmp);  // ✅ Now properly freed
   ```
   
   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - `tmp` now freed in all code paths (success and error)

### ⚠️ Unsafe Memory Operations

1. **~~Uninitialized Variables~~ - FIXED ✅**
   
   **Previous Issue:**
   ```c
   // OLD CODE (DANGEROUS):
   bool digit;  // Uninitialized!
   bool alpha;  // Uninitialized!
   ```
   
   **Now Fixed:**
   ```c
   // NEW CODE (SAFE):
   bool digit = false;
   bool alpha = false;
   ```
   
   **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Variables now properly initialized

2. **Potential Buffer Overflows**
   
   Multiple uses of `strcpy` and `strcat` without bounds checking:
   - `backend/lib/pokergame/src/hand.c:160` - `strcpy(aHandPtr->class, "Straight Flush")`
   - `backend/src/game_room.c:42` - `strncpy` used correctly but inconsistently

---

## 4. Error Handling

### ⚠️ Weaknesses

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Some functions return -1 on error, others return 0
   - No consistent error enum or error codes
   - Many functions don't check return values

2. **Poor Error Messages**
   
   **Location: `backend/lib/db/src/signup.c:73`**
   ```c
   fprintf(stderr, "PstgreSQL error: %s\n", PQerrorMessage(conn));  // Typo: "Pstgre"
   ```

3. **Silent Failures**
   
   **Location: `backend/src/main.c:76-80`**
   ```c
   if (!conn_data || conn_data->fd <= 0)
   {
       logger(MAIN_LOG, "Error", "Invalid connection data");
       continue;  // Just continues without cleanup
   }
   ```

---

## 5. Code Quality & Maintainability

### ✅ Good Practices

1. **Consistent Naming Conventions**
   - Functions use snake_case
   - Structs use PascalCase with typedef
   - Clear prefixes (e.g., `hand_`, `deck_`, `db`)

2. **Header Guards**
   - Proper use of `#pragma once` in headers

3. **Const Correctness** (partial)
   - Some function parameters use `const` appropriately

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

1. **Magic Numbers**
   - Many hardcoded values without named constants:
     ```c
     char buffer[1024];  // What does 1024 represent?
     char query[256];    // Why 256?
     malloc(sizeof(char) * 20);  // Why 20?
     ```

2. **Comments**
   - Excellent block comments in `pokergame.h` explaining data structures
   - Poor inline comments explaining complex logic
   - Commented-out code should be removed (394 lines in `pokergame.c`)

3. **Code Duplication**
   - Similar pattern repeated for each packet handler
   - Could benefit from handler factory pattern

4. **Function Length**
   - `main()` function is 175 lines - too long
   - Should be broken into smaller, testable functions

---

## 6. Testing

### ⚠️ Current State

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Unit tests exist in `backend/test/unit_test.c`
   - Tests cover protocol encoding/decoding
   - No tests for game logic (because it's commented out)
   - No integration tests

2. **Test Quality**
   - Simple assertion-based testing framework
   - Tests are readable but basic
   - No test for error conditions

### Recommendations

- Add tests for all database operations
- Add tests for memory leak detection (Valgrind)
- Add integration tests for server endpoints

---

## 7. Dependencies & Build System

### ✅ Strengths

1. **CMake Configuration**
   - Well-organized CMakeLists.txt files
   - Clear dependency management between libraries
   - Supports multiple targets (server, test, client)

2. **Minimal External Dependencies**
   - PostgreSQL (libpq)
   - Standard C libraries
   - mpack (included)

### ⚠️ Weaknesses

1. **No Dependency Version Locking**
   - No specification of minimum PostgreSQL version
   - No package manager integration (vcpkg, conan)

2. **Build Scripts**
   - `build_all.sh` and `clean_build.sh` exist but not reviewed
   - No CI/CD configuration

---

## 8. Performance Considerations

### ⚠️ Potential Issues

1. **Linear Search in Table Management**
   ```c
   int find_table_by_id(TableList *table_list, int id)
   {
       for (int i = 0; i < table_list->size; i++)  // O(n) lookup
   ```
   
   Recommendation: Use hash table for O(1) lookup

2. **Inefficient String Operations**
   - Multiple `strlen()` calls in loops (e.g., `signup.c:11, 32`)
   - Should cache string length

3. **Database Connection Per Request**
   - Each request creates new PostgreSQL connection
   - Should use connection pooling

---

## 9. Concurrency & Thread Safety

### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. **No Thread Safety**
   - Global variables or shared state not protected
   - `TableList` is shared across all connections but not thread-safe

2. **Race Conditions**
   - Multiple clients can modify `table_list` simultaneously
   - No mutexes or locks observed

**Note**: Using epoll suggests single-threaded event loop, which avoids some issues, but this isn't documented

---

## 10. Documentation

### ✅ Good

1. **README.md**
   - Clear setup instructions
   - Build process documented
   - VSCode configuration provided

2. **Header Comments**
   - Good struct documentation in `pokergame.h`
   - Function prototypes listed

### ⚠️ Needs Improvement

1. **API Documentation**
   - No documentation of protocol format
   - No documentation of packet types
   - No explanation of game flow

2. **Code Comments**
   - Missing comments explaining complex algorithms
   - No explanation of Monte Carlo advisor logic

---
