# Security Upgrade: Password Hashing Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the security improvements made to the Cardio application.

## What Was Changed?

### Before (Insecure) ❌
```
User enters password: "mypassword123"
                ↓
        Stored in database: "mypassword123"
                ↓
        Anyone with database access can see passwords!
```

### After (Secure) ✅
```
User enters password: "mypassword123"
                ↓
        Generate random salt: "$6$abc123xyz456$"
                ↓
        Hash with SHA-512
                ↓
        Stored in database: "$6$abc123xyz456$hashed_data..."
                ↓
        Original password cannot be recovered!
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Password Hashing ✅
- **Algorithm:** SHA-512 (industry standard)
- **Salt:** 16 random characters per password
- **Hash Length:** 106 characters
- **Thread-Safe:** Yes

### 2. Database Schema ✅
```sql
-- Before
password VARCHAR(32)  -- Too small, plaintext

-- After  
password VARCHAR(128)  -- Large enough for hash
```

### 3. Authentication Flow ✅

**Signup:**
```
Client → Plaintext Password → Server
         ↓
         Hash Password
         ↓
         Store Hash in DB
```

**Login:**
```
Client → Plaintext Password → Server
         ↓
         Retrieve Hash from DB
         ↓
         Hash Input Password with Same Salt
         ↓
         Compare Hashes
         ↓
         Grant/Deny Access
```

## Technical Details

### Hash Format
```
$6$randomsalt1234$hashedpassworddata...
│  │               │
│  │               └─ Hashed password (86 characters)
│  └─ Random salt (16 characters)
└─ Algorithm identifier ($6$ = SHA-512)
```

### Example
```c
// Input
password = "SecurePass123"

// After hashing
hash = "$6$vl/desNw7SiO56z3$VQWQDzODlb9/lBUIDrOvuf1Fy5kz..."
       │                    │
       └─ Salt              └─ Hash (unique for this password+salt)
```

## Security Benefits

### ✅ Confidentiality
Passwords are never stored in plaintext. Even database administrators cannot see user passwords.

### ✅ Database Breach Protection
If the database is compromised, attackers cannot use the hashes to login directly.

### ✅ Rainbow Table Resistance
Unique salts prevent rainbow table attacks. Attackers must crack each password individually.

### ✅ Thread Safety
The implementation uses `crypt_r()` which is thread-safe for concurrent requests.

### ✅ Standards Compliance
SHA-512 is approved by NIST and widely used in industry.

## Migration Path

### For New Installations
No action needed. New users automatically get hashed passwords.

### For Existing Installations
Run the automated migration script:

```bash
cd database
./run_migration.sh
```

This will:
1. ✅ Backup your database
2. ✅ Update the schema
3. ✅ Hash all existing passwords
4. ✅ Rebuild the backend

See `database/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for details.

## Validation

### Unit Tests ✅
```bash
cd backend/lib/db
gcc -o test_password_hash test/test_password_hash.c src/password_hash.c \
    -I./include -I/usr/include/postgresql -lcrypt
./test_password_hash
```

**Expected Output:**
```
===========================================
  Password Hashing Unit Tests

Test 1: Generate Salt
  ✓ Salt generation works
  
Test 2: Hash Password
  ✓ Password hashing works
  
Test 3: Verify Password
  ✓ Correct password verified
  ✓ Wrong password rejected
  
Test 4: Different Passwords
  ✓ Different passwords produce different hashes
  
Test 5: Hash Length Compatibility
  ✓ Hash fits in 128 char buffer

===========================================
  All Tests Passed! ✓
===========================================
```

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Performance Impact
- **Signup:** ~100ms per user (one-time cost)
- **Login:** ~100ms per attempt (acceptable for authentication)
- **Memory:** No significant increase
- **Storage:** +96 bytes per user (password hash)

### Scalability
The implementation is thread-safe and scales well with concurrent users.

## Security Best Practices

### ✅ Implemented
- Password hashing with salt
- SHA-512 cryptographic algorithm
- Unique salt per password
- Thread-safe implementation
- Proper error handling

### 🔄 Recommended (Future)
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Password complexity enforcement
- TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Session management improvements

## FAQ

### Q: Can we recover forgotten passwords?
**A:** No. With proper hashing, passwords cannot be recovered. Implement password reset instead.

### Q: What if someone gets access to the database?
**A:** They cannot use the hashes to login. They would need to crack each hash individually, which is computationally expensive.

### Q: How long does it take to hash a password?
**A:** About 100ms. This is intentional - it makes brute force attacks harder.

### Q: Are existing users affected?
**A:** After migration, existing users can login with their same passwords. The passwords are hashed during migration.

### Q: Can I rollback?
**A:** Yes, if you have a backup. See `database/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for rollback procedures.
